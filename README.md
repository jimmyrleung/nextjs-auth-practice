# Next.js auth practice

This is a simple TODO list project to practice Next.js auth using it as a "fullstack" framework (both React + API capability features)

## Goals

1. Explore Next.js
2. Understand better the role of the `pages` folder
3. Understand better the SSR mechanism
4. Practice token-based authentication using access and refresh tokens
5. Explore the `api` mechanism that Next.js offers and understand what are the challenges when using it as a "Fullstack" framework

## To be added

- [ ] Unit tests - since the idea was to explore Next.js and authentication, I didn't add any unit tests, but to be honest I feel weird so this is something I really wanna do.

- [ ] Cypress tests - I think this project is also a good candidate to explore Cypress.

## Project setup

To run this project locally you just have to execute the following steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. run `npm install`
3. run `npm run setup-db` - this will create the local SQLite database and seed the initial data
4. run `npm run dev` to start the project in development mode.
